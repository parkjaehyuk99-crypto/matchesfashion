                <h3 class="notowB16">5. Managing Preferences</h3>
                <p>You can control how we send personalised marketing - by channel and by frequency - from the Manage Preferences section of your registered account.</p>
                <p>Accessing Manage Preferences allows you to control how we communicate with you. If you do not wish to receive marketing communications from us you can unsubscribe from the link in the email you received or change your Marketing Preferences.</p>
                <p>For marketing purposes, we occasionally use information about our customers to generate audiences of existing and prospective customers through third-party marketing partners. This allows us to target advertisements to potential customers who appear to have shared interests or similar demographics to our existing customers based on the platforms' own data, or existing customers based on data we have collected. We typically do this by exposing a user's SHA256 hashed email addresses to third party marketing partners. These partners will match the hashed data against their own customers, generate the audience, then delete the uploaded list and use it for no other purpose. We do not have access to the identity of anybody in the audience as it is uploaded. Based on this, we believe that generating audiences poses little or no threat to the privacy of our customers while it enhances our ability to grow as a company and offer you the best service. If you wish to opt out you can send us an email at customercare@matchesfashion.com.</p>
