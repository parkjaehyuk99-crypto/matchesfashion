                <p>In order to keep your MATCHES account safe, we recommend you follow the simple steps below.</p>
                <p>When setting your password, it must be at least 6 characters and contain at least one uppercase letter and a number. The longer your password is, the more secure it is.</p>
                <p>Use a unique password on MATCHES. Using a unique password will ensure that if your password is disclosed on another website, it cannot be used on MATCHES.</p>
                <p>Do not use the same password for your email accounts as you do on sites like MATCHES.</p>
                <p>Change your password periodically. While we do not require users to change passwords after a period of time, it is recommended to update your password periodically.</p>
                <p>Change your password if you suspect that any of the accounts you use online on any website has been compromised.</p>

                <h3 class="merwR20">How will I know if you have received my order?</h3>
                <p>
                    When your credit card is authorised, funds are put on hold until the transaction is completed and we will send you a confirmation email that we have received your order. In the meantime we will prepare your order.
                </p>
                <p>Once your order is ready to be shipped, we will send you a confirmation via email that your order is ready to be shipped.</p>
                <p>When your order is shipped, your payment will be processed and we will send you a dispatch confirmation email containing your tracking details.</p>
                <p>
                    Your billing information must be exactly as it appears on your credit card statement. If any numbers are different, the order cannot be processed.
                    Be sure to correctly spell city names and avoid using abbreviations unless that is how your information appears on your statement.
                </p>
                <p>Contact your financial institution if you need the exact billing address associated with your credit card.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Our delivery partner will contact you once your items are in customs to let you know the cost. This may delay your delivery time as goods held at customs are it's your responsibility to pay the necessary charges for local authorities to release the goods.</p>

                <h3 class="merwR20">Why are shipping restrictions applied to some products?</h3>
                <p>Due to international trading agreements and regulations, MATCHES must adhere to some specific shipping restrictions.</p>
                <p>We are unable to ship exotic skins outside the UK. For any customers outside the UK wishing to purchase an item containing exotic skins, please contact Customer Care.</p>
                <p>In addition, we are required by UK regulation to obtain a CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) permit before items made from exotic skins can be shipped.</p>
                <p>This may cause a delay in processing your order.</p>
                <p>Please note, if you are travelling you must carry your CITES permit at all times, otherwise, your item can be confiscated by the local customs.</p>
                <p>Fine jewellery cannot be dispatched to Russia. Customers in Russia wishing to purchase fine jewellery must arrange for their shipment to be delivered outside of the Russian Federation.</p>
