MATCHES will account to the relevant authorities for all duty payable.</p>
                        <p>Please note, duty is applied as a flat rate percentage of the total item value for all products.

Final payment will be made in either GBP £, EUR €, USD $, AUD $, HKD $ or JPY ¥. As such, final credit card and debited amounts may vary based on currency fluctuations and bank commissions. MATCHES encourages customers to contact their home bank to receive the accurate price conversion and any bank commissions related to the transactions.</p>
                        <p>If you are shipping to the US, Customs Duty has been pre-paid for you by MATCHESFASHION with no additional charges on delivery.

                        <p>Please read our return policy carefully to ensure you can proceed with your request as quickly as possible.</p>
                        <p>All returns should be sent back to us in their original packaging provided. Please ensure when returning the parcel that the MATCHESFASHION box is properly protected with the plastic bag provided.</p>
                        <p>You have 14 days from receipt of your order to request your returns number, which will be displayed online and emailed to you. Unsuitable items must then be returned within 7 days of receiving your returns number. Returns outside this window may be accepted at our discretion. The item(s) should be returned unworn and in perfect condition, with all MATCHES and designer garment tags still attached. Returns that are damaged, soiled, or returned without their original labels may not be accepted and may be sent back to the customer.</p>
                        <p>To ensure your return is covered by our returns policy and does not encounter a delay, items must be returned using the original packaging provided and from the same country to which they were delivered. Items returned from a different country may incur additional charges or be delayed by customs. You can return using any secure means but we may not accept liability.</p>
                        <p>Before your parcel leaves our warehouse, it is fully checked and controlled by our packing team. If you receive an item which is damaged, please contact us immediately. Where provided, any designer packaging such as authenticity cards, dust bags, and leather tags should be included in your return.</p>
                        <p>Footwear should be returned unmarked and in its original and undamaged packaging as this is considered part of the product.

                        <p>Whilst we offer a flexible returns policy, we do monitor the number of returns and note any unusual returns activity. Unusual activity could be where items are returned which we suspect have been worn (not just tried on) or damaged, returns which have missing or incorrect items, or returning significantly more than we consider normal. This unusual activity or other breaches of returns policy could result in closure of your MATCHES account. We also reserve the right to take other appropriate action, depending on the particular circumstances, such as withholding issuing a refund or legal action.</p>

                            You may occasionally receive discount codes from us, via email or through promotional materials.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Free shipping offers apply to the entry-level delivery option. Free shipping offers on new-season orders are valid only on full-price items. In all cases, only the delivery is free. Any taxes, duties or customs fees are chargeable. The promotional code FREESHIP is valid on all orders over £200/€200/USD $250/AUD $300/HKD $2,000/¥30,000. The promotional code USAFREE is only applicable on orders shipped to the United States. The promotional code FREEAUS is only applicable on orders shipped to Australia. Codes cannot be used in conjunction with any offer at MATCHESFASHION.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each code is unique to the recipient, is not transferable, has no monetary value and under no circumstances can it be converted into currency. Each code has an expiry date, which will be stated at the time of promotion or on accompanying promotional materials which cannot be modified. Some discount codes may be redeemed both in store and online, or when specified, for online purchases only. Again, this will be stipulated at the time of promotion and on accompanying promotional materials.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When an order is placed using a promotional code and contains a number of items, the value of the discount is spread over each item according to the pro-rated value of that item. Any refund of an item purchased in such an order will be reduced by the value of discount attached to it. The 'discount' will not be refunded.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Under no circumstances can the value of a discount code be deducted from an order if that code is defective or out of date: no replacement codes will be issued.

                <p>
                    Your credit card company may undertake an additional security check to confirm it is you making the order. All credit/debit cardholders are subject to validation checks and authorisation by the card issuer. If the issuer of your payment card refuses, or subsequently refuses to, or does not, for any reason, authorise payment to us, we will not be liable for any delay or non-delivery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We regret to inform you that anyone who is a MATCHESFASHION/MaxMara account card holder will not be able to use their cards to purchase online until further notice, however it is a service we hope to offer in the near future.

                    We will retain the legal ownership of the Items until full payment has been made by you and such payment has been received by us.

                <p>
                    Many national laws give consumers specific rights in relation to faulty goods, such as the right to claim a refund, replacement, repair and/or compensation. Examples include rights under the UK Consumer Rights Act 2015 and the EU Guarantee. MATCHES will always honour your legal rights, so please familiarise yourself with your local laws.  
                    Subject to, and without prejudice to, any legal rights that you may have, the following terms and conditions apply to MATCHES' after sales services for damaged and/or faulty goods:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        (a) Once MATCHES has reviewed your after care claim, we will confirm your options. Depending on your location and the timeframe from purchase, you may be offered a refund, an exchange, or we may request you to send the item for repair to the relevant third party brand or to one of our local repair partners.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (b) If we request you to send an item back to a third-party brand for repair, MATCHES will cover the cost of shipping. Please note that repairs by the brand may take in excess of 8 weeks. If this time frame is unsuitable, MATCHES may offer alternatives in compliance with your legal rights.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (c) If we request you to send an item for repairs with our local repair partners, MATCHES will cover the cost of shipping and reasonable repair. Please note that repairs may take in excess of 3 weeks. If this time frame is unsuitable, MATCHES may offer alternatives in compliance with your legal rights.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (d) In some instances, MATCHES may request the item to be returned to MATCHES for inspection ahead of proposing a solution, in which case MATCHES will cover the cost of shipping.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (e) Where damage is not deemed to be a manufacturing fault, charges for repair may apply.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (f) MATCHES is not liable for any repairs or alterations that you undertake or arrange yourself, instead of sending the item to MATCHES (or our local repair partner or the third-party brand, as applicable).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (g) MATCHES retains the right to reject any request for after care services, which does not fulfil the legal criteria. This includes items which have been improperly stored or used (e.g. accidental damage or damage due to general wear and tear), damage caused by external events (e.g. fire and floods), and items that have been subject to alterations by a third party other than MATCHES, one of our repair partners (under our direction) or the relevant brand. Our team will provide more information in response to individual requests.
